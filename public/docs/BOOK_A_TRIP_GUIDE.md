## Getting Your Booking Link

Your transportation provider (limo company, airport shuttle, black car service, etc.) will give you a **booking link**. It looks like:

**https://onyxdispatch.us/booking/YOURCODE**

- Replace **YOURCODE** with the code your provider gave you (e.g. `ACME123`, `GLS`).
- You may receive this link by email, text, or from their website.

**Don't have a link?** Contact your provider and ask for their online booking URL.

## Opening the Booking Page

1. **Click the link** or paste it into your web browser
2. **Wait for the page to load** – you'll see your provider's name and a booking form
3. **Use a phone, tablet, or computer** – the page works on all devices

**Tip:** Bookmark the link so you can book again easily.
