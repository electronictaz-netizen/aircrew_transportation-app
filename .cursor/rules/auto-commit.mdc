# Auto-commit after work

When you finish a task, feature, or fix, **commit the changes** before ending your response.

## When to commit

- After completing a user-requested change (new feature, bugfix, refactor)
- After finishing a multi-step task
- When the user has accepted your changes and there are staged or unstaged edits

## When to skip

- Only trivial/exploratory edits with no user ask
- User explicitly says not to commit

## How to commit

1. `git add` the files you changed (or `git add -A` for the current scope)
2. `git commit -m "Clear, imperative message"` describing what was done
3. Optionally `git push` if the user typically pushes (e.g. they work on a single branch)

Keep messages short and imperative, e.g.:
- "Add rate limiting to publicBooking Lambda"
- "Fix isActive handling in getCompanyByCode"
- "Update PUBLIC_BOOKING_LAMBDA_SETUP troubleshooting"
