## What Are Trip Templates?

Trip Templates are saved trip configurations that you can reuse to quickly create new trips. Instead of entering the same pickup/dropoff locations, passenger counts, and other details repeatedly, you create a template once and use it whenever you need that type of trip.

### Example Use Cases
- **Airport Routes**: "BUF Airport to Downtown Hotels"
- **Corporate Routes**: "Office to Airport"
- **Standard Routes**: "Hotel District to Convention Center"
- **Recurring Jobs**: Weekly corporate shuttle routes

## Access Requirements

- **Premium Tier Subscription** required
- Available to Managers and Administrators
- Access via: **Configuration** → **Trip Templates**
